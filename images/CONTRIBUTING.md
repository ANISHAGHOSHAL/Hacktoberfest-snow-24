# Contributing to this repo

This is a host repo to another repos, so there isn't much to contribute to it.

But if you do have something to contribute, the only requirements are:

- The contribution should not be "spammy"
- No edits to the root README.MD file are allowed

The root README.md file is auto generated by a combination of GitHub and ServiceNow workflows. Any changes directly to this file will immediately be overwritten, therefore any contributions directly to this file are useless.

Instead, contributions should be directed to this file: [.github/templates/rootreadmetemplate.md](/README.md). This file is used to generate most of the README.md file
